# Sliding Window Piecewise Linear Segmentation
An optimized O(N) implementation of the sliding window algorithm for piecewise linear segmentation of a time series. This algorithm will fit trend lines to a series and can be used online or offline.

### Usage guide:
* Add sliding_window.py to your project folder
* from sliding_window.py import sliding_window, sliding_window_online
* To use the offline segmentation, pass the time_series as a list of points
* To use the online segmentation, pass one point to the function and repeat as new points become available.
